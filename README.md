# PCB-defect-detection-with-regional-attention-transformer
this is a PCB defect detection thesis and code using transformer method and optimize it, do not requires set the default box, only need each pixel position, so this method can be made easily to use for any PCB style.
ours thesis in the (https://hdl.handle.net/11296/jvqvsb), but unfortunately ours only have Chinese version.
# Thanks
this thesis used data is form DeepPCB: https://github.com/tangsanli5201/DeepPCB and TDD-Net https://github.com/Ixiaohuihuihui/Tiny-Defect-Detection-for-PCB (Augmentation dataset), ours very thanks for both thesis public dataset, make we to use.
